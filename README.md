# SFML-Pong
Pong was my second delve into SFML, bringing along the challenge of having multiple game states, keyboard controls, two players and an AI system. This I found extremely engaging and enjoyable, trying to implement as many different features as possible to improve the game. This game worksheet project taught me much into AI systems, how to handle multiple players input's and possible interactions in different game states.
